# Michael Musselman — E-Portfolio

Your portfolio website for GitHub Pages.

## How to use
- Edit `index.html`, `about.html`, `skills.html`, `contact.html`.
- Add screenshots to `assets/img/` and link from artifact pages.
- Put PDFs in `/docs/` so buttons work on Contact page.
- Add your assignment ZIPs into `/artifacts/` so evidence buttons work.

## Projects
- Update `/assets/data/projects.json` to change the Projects page cards.

## Paths
- This repo is a **user site**, so absolute paths like `/assets/css/style.css` are correct.
