  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I'm Michael Musselman, a second-year Computer Systems Technology student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. After 18 years in retail operations and procurement, I'm making the move into technology—bringing along the problem-solving instincts, team leadership experience, and business perspective that come from running stores and managing national-level buying programs.</p>

  <p>I value maintainable code, clear documentation, and thoughtful user experience. This portfolio showcases work from my academic journey and personal projects, with reflections on what I've learned along the way.</p>

  <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
  <p>I'm seeking entry-level roles in software development or data analytics where I can contribute immediately while continuing to grow. I'm particularly interested in teams that value collaboration and see my business background as an asset rather than a detour. Whether it's building internal tools, working with data, or developing customer-facing applications, I want to be solving real problems alongside people who care about their craft.</p>

  <h2>Where I'm Headed</h2>
  <p>Long-term, I'm drawn to technical leadership—the kind where you're still hands-on with code but also helping others develop their skills and shipping software that actually makes a difference. My years of managing teams and mentoring staff showed me how much I enjoy that side of work, and I'd like to carry that into a technical career.</p>

  <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
  <p>Right now I'm focused on development and design patterns, database architecture, modern web frameworks, and getting comfortable with cloud platforms. My coursework wraps up in 2026, but I'm building projects and learning independently alongside the formal curriculum.</p>
