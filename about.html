  <p>My background in retail operations has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving, team leadership, and process optimization. Now, I'm channeling that experience into building software that makes a difference.</p>

  <p>I value maintainable code, clear documentation, and thoughtful user experience. This portfolio showcases representative work from my academic journey and personal projects, with reflections on what I've learned along the way.</p>

  <h2>Career Goals</h2>

    <li><strong>Short term:</strong> Secure a new-grad role in software development or data analytics where I can apply my technical skills and continue learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Medium term:</strong> Take ownership of end-to-end feature delivery, improve system reliability, and mentor junior developers.</li>
    <li><strong>Long term:</strong> Lead engineering teams that ship user-centered software and foster a culture of continuous improvement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>

    <li>Advanced Java development and design patterns</li>
    <li>Database design and optimization</li>
